Run::Parts

Run::Parts offers functionality of Debian's run-parts tool in Perl.

run-parts runs all the executable files named within constraints
described below, found in the given directory.  Other files and
directories are silently ignored.

Additionally it can just print the names of the all matching files
(not limited to executables, but ignores blacklisted files like
e.g. backup files), but don't actually run them.

This is useful when functionality or configuration is split over
multiple files in one directory. A typical convention is that the
directory name ends in ".d". Common examples for such splittet
configuration directories:

  /etc/cron.d/
  /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/,
  /etc/aptitude-robot/pkglist.d/
  /etc/logrotate.d/
  /etc/rsyslog.d/

Run::Parts contains two backend implementation. Run::Parts::Debian
actually uses /bin/run-parts and Run::Parts::Perl is a pure Perl
implementation of a basic set of run-parts' functionality.

Run::Parts::Debian may or may not work with RedHat's simplified
shell-script based reimplementation of Debian's run-parts.

By default Run::Parts uses Run::Parts::Debian if /bin/run-parts
exists, Run::Parts::Perl otherwise. But you can also choose any of the
backends explicitly.
