=head1 NAME

Run::Parts - Perl interface to Debian's run-parts tool

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.02';


=head1 SYNOPSIS

Perl interface to Debian's run-parts tool. run-parts runs all the
executable files named within constraints described below, found in
the given directory.  Other files and directories are silently
ignored.

Additionally it can just print the names of the all matching files
(not limited to executables, but ignores blacklisted files like
e.g. backup files), but don't actually run them.

This is useful when functionality or configuration is split over
multiple files in one directory.

Perhaps a little code snippet.

    use Run::Parts;

    my $rp = Run::Parts->new('directory);

    my @file_list        = $rp->list;
    my @executables_list = $rp->test;
    my $commands_output  = $rp->run;
    â€¦

=head1 EXPORT

A list of functions that can be exported.  You can delete this section
if you don't export anything, such as for a purely object-oriented module.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new (Constructor)

Creates a new Run::Parts object. Takes one parameter, the directory on
which run-parts should work.

=cut

sub new {
    my $self = {};
    bless($self, shift);
    $self->{dir} = shift;

    return $self
}

=head2 run_parts_command

Returns the run-parts to run with the given command parameter

=cut

sub run_parts_command {
    my $self = shift;
    my $rp_cmd = shift;

    my $command =
        "/bin/run-parts " .
        ((defined($rp_cmd) and $rp_cmd ne '') ? "'--$rp_cmd'" : '') .
        " '".$self->{dir}."'";

    return wantarray ?
        do { my @l = `$command`; chomp(@l); return @l } :
        `$command`;
}

=head2 list

Lists all relevant files in the given directory. Equivalent to

=cut

sub list {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->run_parts_command('list');
}

=head2 test

Lists all relevant executables in the given directory. Equivalent to

=cut

sub test {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->run_parts_command('test');
}

=head2 run

Runs all relevant executables in the given directory. Equivalent to
